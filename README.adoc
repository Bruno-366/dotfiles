My dotfiles for {ArchLinux}

## Desktop Enviroment

[start=0]
. login `bash` shell with `{bash_profile}`
. `startx` (wrapper around `xinit`) with file `{xinitrc}`
.. i3wm with file ???
** `{st}` with non-login `bash` shell using `{bashrc}` 
** `{ranger}` 
** `{surf}`
. `{vim}` with `{vimrc}`


### Sound

Use ALSA instead of pulse-audio  

in `{xinitrc}` and `{bash_profile}`:
```sh
export ALSA_CARD="Generic"
```
sets the default sound output device to the inbuild speakers  

using surf:

```sh
ALSA_CARD=Generic surf # this becomes redundant, its the implied default
ALSA_CARD=Headset surf # if you want to use the headset
```

Unfortunately, you can't change the enviroment variables of an already running process.

### APL

Add an additional keyboard layout for APL in `{xinitrc}`

### Shutdown, Poweroff, Suspend, Hibernate etc.

```sh
# use poweroff instead of:
# alias shutdown="shutdown -P now"
```

## Finding modified files

```sh
pacman -Qkk
```

For example

```sh
   : # check which package owns a file
   : pacman -Qo /etc/i3status.conf
/etc/i3status.conf is owned by i3status 

   : # If no changes were made:
   : pacman -Qkk i3status
i3status: 12 total files, 0 altered files

   : # If some changes were made:
   : pacman -Qkk i3status
backup file: i3status: /etc/i3status.conf (Modification time mismatch)
backup file: i3status: /etc/i3status.conf (Size mismatch)
backup file: i3status: /etc/i3status.conf (MD5 checksum mismatch)
backup file: i3status: /etc/i3status.conf (SHA256 checksum mismatch)
i3status: 12 total files, 0 altered files
```
